, 

This is me: Lovis, 
I am studying economics since I think that these are highly relevant studies to make to take informed responsabilities in the real world and society. 
I am eager to finisch them and to start working. 
At the same time I am considering how to merge my music-studies with the more academic studies that I am doing now.
This is quite a big task, as I haven't found any convincing solution yet. 

In order to get to know new perspectives on how to find a more convincing pathway, I have applied to the HSG Mentoring program. If taken, I hope to acquire new insights and have a more positive look on my career. 

lets write another day again, I have to finish my assignment in Data-handling, which is a compulsatory course in my major.

see you!
